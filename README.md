Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. The insert
and delete operations are often called push and pop.


empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity: O(1)
size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
top() – Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
push(a) – Inserts the element ‘a’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
pop() – Deletes the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
